# EDU AIDE
## SDG: Quality Education
We have chosen Quality Education as our challenge and devised a solution for it. 
We aimed to provide information that will ensure quality education to college students.
## About our website:
  Misinformation is a major threat we face in this digital world. The main crisis faced by students who are pursuing their college is that they are either misinformed or not informed at the right time. Since it is the time that teenagers are coming out of the nest they are unfamiliar with the world around them which takes a toll on their education. Especially the students who go abroad for studies face the most difficulties.  We took an oath to eradicate the threat of misinformation by providing genuine information free of cost.
  EDU AIDE is an information website that guides college students in terms of choosing a college, Internship, Courses and also provides other general details that come in handy for students who are pursuing their studies in other cities. We also act as a bridge between the sponsors and the students for free access.
We intend to provide two types of services. The basic service and other general services.
  In **Basic service**, we provide information about sponsors who are willing to donate generously to the students. And we have easy access to **Medical aid** for students with medical emergencies.In our sponsorship program, we make certain that our users' privacy is protected at both ends. We double-check entries registering and the one's going for the scholarships.  In **General services**, we have included necessary information about various sectors for the benefit of students.
  ## Interface Design:
   Our website has the simplest user interface with easy navigating. Our color theme is bright with blue considering people with color blindness. We have our icons big and visible with a steady flow.
